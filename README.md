# Code Search

Ever have searching for stuff while coding, and finding results for all kinds of old or incorrect versions?

Code Search solves that problem: search for a specific framework and version, e.g. you can search for:

- .net 8 jwt authentication
- jdk 17 BigInteger
- etc.

Future versions will support understanding queries without versions/frameworks explicitly mentioned.
